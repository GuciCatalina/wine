            <p>
                Founded in 1990 by The Martini Family. Ann and John Martini moved to Yates County in 1973 to grow
                grapes and raise their family on 100 acres overlooking Seneca Lake. Their children, Peter, Sarah,
                Maeve and Elizabeth, have been involved in the vineyard and winery throughout their growing years and
                are now full-time employees/co-owners of Anthony Road Wine Company. The location of the vineyards in
                close proximity to Seneca Lake lends itself to a favorable microclimate for grape growing. Cooling in
                the summer and a few degrees above average temperatures during the winter.

                Riesling, Cabernet Franc, and Gewurztraminer. The name, “Boundary Breaks” refers to the gorges on the

                a 140-acre farm located on the southeastern slopes of Seneca Lake. The Renos replaced the existing
                vineyards, comprised primarily of native grape varieties (Catawba, Niagara, and Concord), with fine
                wine grapes. They re-planted 50 acres of grapes. Chardonnay , Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc,

                Céline and Sébastien LeSeurre are a French husband and wife winemaking team living and working in the
                Finger Lakes. When they first moved to New York, they explored the Finger Lakes by visiting and sampling
                grapes from the many different terroirs — geography, geology, and climate of a certain place — and soon
                determined this is the best place to grow beautiful grapes and craft fine wine together. They
                unite their French heritage and new world wine experience to develop Finger Lakes wines that pair well
                with fine cuisine as well as casual fare.
